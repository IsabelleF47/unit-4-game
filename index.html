        <!-- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. -->
       <div class="container">
           <div class="row">

        <!-- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. -->
        
        <!-- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. -->
        
        <!-- Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal. -->
        <!-- When they do click one, update the player's score counter. -->
        <!-- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. -->
        
        <!-- The player loses if their score goes above the random number. -->
        
        <!-- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. -->
        
        <!-- When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero. -->
        <!-- The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game. -->
        
        <!-- Option 1 Game design notes -->
        <!-- The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120. -->
         <!-- Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12. -->
